    "Description": [
      "In 2014, Microsoft organized and established the .NET Foundation, and Microsoft took another step forward on the road to becoming a major open source participant.",
      "Since 2014, many well-known companies have joined the .NET Foundation. The three major cloud vendors of Google, Microsoft, and AWS have gathered at the .NET Foundation. In the platform project, the ARM architecture on the .NET platform is contributed by the Samsung team. NET Core 3.1 has been fully supported, and .NET 5 has been further optimized. The domestic Loongson team is developing support for the MIPS architecture and will officially release .NET Core 3.1 For MIPS. In order to turn the .NET Foundation into a more diverse and member-driven organization. Microsoft has truly entrusted the development of .NET to the community in order to make OSS truly flourish.",
      "Since 2016, our .NET community has promoted the development of .NET open source projects and communities through collaboration. Many Chinese .NET open source developer organizations are active on github/gitee, such as NCC, Shengpai Developer, EasyAbp, Loongson.NET, etc. We have .NET clubs in major cities across the country to hold regular events. This year, due to the epidemic, more live events are online. At the successful .Net Conf 2020 held on November 10th, .NET 5 has been officially released at the conference. In 2019, we also successfully held the first China .NET Developers Summit in Shanghai. This year we will continue to host the second China Summit of the .NET Community in Suzhou."
